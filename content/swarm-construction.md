## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a bridge autonomously using a swarm of drones.

---
## Gripper Design
Lightweight passive grippers are preferred due to the dronesâ€™ weight and control constraints. Each gripper must be capable of attaching to, carrying, and releasing the building blocks reliably.

**Previous designs**:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <img src="/images/projects/construction/gripperv1.gif" alt="gripperv1" style="width: 48%; height: auto;"/>
    <img src="/images/projects/construction/gripperv2.gif" alt="gripperv2" style="width: 48%; height: auto;"/>
</div>
<br>

**Finalized design**:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <img src="/images/projects/construction/gripperv3.gif" alt="gripperv3" style="width: 48%; height: auto;"/>
    <img src="/images/projects/construction/drox_attached.jpg" alt="a droxel attached to a drone" style="width: 48%; height: auto;"/>
</div>
<br>

## Next Steps
Conduct flight tests with a single drone, followed by scaling up to multiple drones for the construction task.
